# What is Dependency Injection?
> "Don't call us, we'll call you", Hollywood principle

**[Dependency Injection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKD2-MAkXyQ) (DI)** involves passing (injecting) one or more dependencies (or services) to a dependent object (or client) which become part of the clientâ€™s state.
It is like the Strategy Pattern, except the strategy is set once, at construction. DI enables loosely coupled designs, which are easier to maintain and test.

In short, DI is all about construction!

                              pump->pump();                   |         : heater(heater), pump(move(pump))

                                                              | };
```

### Do I use a Dependency Injection already?

* If you are using constructors in your code then you are probably using some form of Dependency Injection too!

```cpp
class Button {
 public:
  Button(const std::string& name, Position position); // Dependency Injection!
};
```

### Do I use Dependency Injection correctly?

Common mistakes when using Dependency Injection are:

  * **Passing a dependency to create another dependency inside your object**

    It's a bad practice to pass dependencies to an object just in order
    to create another one with those dependencies.
    It's much cleaner to create the latter object beforehand and pass it to the former.

```cpp
class Model {
 public:
   Model(int width, int height)
     : board(std::make_unique<Board>(width, height)) // Bad
   { }

   explicit Model(std::unique_ptr<IBoard> board) // Better
     : board(std::move(board))
   { }

   ...

 private:
  std::unique_ptr<IBoard> board;
};
```

  * **Carrying dependencies**

    It's also important NOT to pass depenencies through layers of constructors (carrying them).
    It's much better to always pass only dependecies which are required ONLY by the given constructor.

```cpp
class Model : public Service { // Bad
 public:
   explicit Model(std::unique_ptr<IBoard> board) // Bad
     : Service(std::move(board))
   { }

   void update() {
     Service::do_something_with_board(); // Bad
   }
};

class Model { // Better
 public:
   explicit Model(std::unique_ptr<Service> service) // Better
     : service(std::move(service))
   { }

   void update() {
     service->do_something_with_board(); // Better
   }

 private:
   std::unique_ptr<Service> service;
};
```

  * **Carrying injector (Service Locator pattern)**

    Service locator is consider to be an anti-pattern because its instance
    is required to be passed as the ONLY constructor parameter into all
    constructors. Such approach makes the code highly coupled to the Service Locator framework.
    It's better to pass required dependencies direclty instead and use a DI framework to inject them.

```cpp
class Model {
 public:
   explicit Model(service_locator& sl) // Bad (ask)
     : service(sl.resolve<unique_ptr<Service>>())
   { }

   explicit Model(std::unique_ptr<Service> service) // Better (tell)
     : service(std::move(service))
   { }

   ...

 private:
   std::unique_ptr<Service> service;
};
```

  * **Not using strong typedefs for constructor parameters**

    Being explicit and declarative is always better than being impilicit.
    Using common types (ex. numbers) in order to define any common-like type may cause
    missusage of the constructor interface. Using `strong typedefs` is easier to follow and
    protects against missusage of the constructor interface.

```cpp
class Board {
 public:
   Board(int /*width*/, int /*height*/)  // Bad; Board{2, 3} vs Board{3, 2}?

   Board(width, height) // Better, explicit; Board{width{2}, height{3}};

   ...
};
```

### Do I need a Dependency Injection?

* DI provides loosely coupled code (separation of business logic and object creation)
* DI provides easier to maintain code (different objects might be easily injected)
* DI provides easier to test code (fakes objects might be injected)

</table>

### Do I need a DI Framework/Library?

Depending on a project and its scale you may put up with or without a DI library, however, in any project
a DI framework may **free you** from maintaining a following (boilerplate) code...

```cpp
logger logger_;
renderer renderer_;
view view_{renderer_, logger_};
model model_{logger_};
controller controller_{model_, view_, logger_};
user user_{logger_};
app app_{controller_, user_};
```
Notice that **ORDER** in which above dependencies are created is **IMPORTANT** as well as that
**ANY** change in **ANY** of the objects constructor will **REQUIRE** a change in this code!

#### Manual DI - Wiring Mess (Avoid it by using [Boost].DI)

```
* Single Responsibility Principle
  =>
    * A lot of classes
    =>
      * Wiring Mess
      =>
        * Hard to maintain + Lazy programmers (99%)
        =>
          * Hacks/Workarounds (~~Single Responsibility~~)
```

![CPP(BTN)](Run_Motivation_Example|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-ext/di/cpp14/example/motivation.cpp)
<br />

Right now, imagine a project with hundreds or thousands of those dependencies and a critical issue
which has to be fixed ASAP. Unfortunately, in order to fix the bug properly a new non-trivial dependency has to be
introduced.

Now, imagine that a 'smart' dev figured out that it will be much easier to extend the functionally
of already passed object and sneak a workaround/'solution' this way. Such approach will possibly break the **[single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)**
of the changed object but no worries though, it might be refactored later on (meaning: most likely, the workaround will stay unchanged forever and that there are no tests).

**If that sounds familiar**, take a look into DI library as it helps to solve developer dilemma by taking care
of creating all required dependencies whereas dev may focus on fixing and testing the issue.

**DI library**, not only let you forget about maintaining dependencies creation (See [Create Objects Tree](tutorial.md#1-basic-create-objects-tree)),
but also can help you with...

* Testing (See [Mocks Provider](extensions.md#mocks-provider))
* Serializing (See [Serialize](extensions.md#serialize))
* Understand code dependencies (See [UML Dumper](extensions.md#uml-dumper))
* Restrict what types and how they should be created (See [Constructible Policy](user_guide.md#di_constructible))
